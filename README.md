# TrafficControlSimulation
Traffic Control Simulation with STM32 and Proteus

* I did not share the project directly, as it may cause problems 
when opening the project on another computer.
* I shared main.c file, proteus schematic and pinout.
* The sound sensor is simulated with a potentiometer.
* The GPS module is simulated with random values.

*** You need to use an LCD library and an infrared sensor library.
* Link of the LCD library I used (You may need to make some changes to the LCD library.):

* Link of the infrared sensor library I used:

*** In order to get accurate results, the button must be pressed
when the input pins of the infrared sensors are LOW.
